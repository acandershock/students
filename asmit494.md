## Background Information
My name is Annalise Smith. Some basic information:
    * My netid is asmit494
    * My github username is asmith7939
    * My major is computer science

I am from Knoxville, Tennessee, born and raised. This is my fourth year at UTK because I changed my major, but I am going to be getting a minor in machine learning to avoid being part-time in my last semester. 

As far as interests go, sadly, I am interested in a [video game](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) which I have spent over 2000 hours on and a bit too much money. I also love music, and I am what is called a Swiftie. However my music taste is more than that, varying from artists like Sleep Token and Deftones, to Noah Kahan and Hozier, to Gracie Abrams and Phoebe Bridgers. My total Spotify wrapped time last year was 271,526 minutes after all. I am also a classically trained violinist and have been playing for 16 years.

I am proficient in C++ and Java, but thanks to working on a developer team in Hack4Impact I am getting better at using Typescript, Node.js, React, CSS, and HTML
