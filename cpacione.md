### Background

I was born and raised in Springfield, Illinois and went to Pleasant Plains High School. My family moved to Texas when I moved to Tennessee. I have one older and two younger siblings, and one dog.

The computer language I am most proficient in (and my favorite) is C++, but I learned how to code on JavaScript.
