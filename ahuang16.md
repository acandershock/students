## Background
Hello! My name is Amy and I'm a junior in Computer Science with a minor in Machine Learning. Professionally, I've worked as a research assistant in a CEE lab, a developer at Hack4Impact, and as an Automation Solutions Intern. I also got to participate in the DOE's pilot HPC Bootcamp at Berkeley Lab. 

## Interests
I am passionate about learning, creating, and making an impact,  which led me to web development. I am also interested in machine learning and automation. Outside of development, I love baking and cooking. While I don't have a website to share my personal recipes yet, I can link a few of my favorite online recipes! These [nutella-stuffed chocolate chip cookies][https://sugarspunrun.com/nutella-stuffed-cookies/] and this [guacamole][https://downshiftology.com/recipes/best-ever-guacamole/#wprm-recipe-container-33907] are both absolutely delicious.
