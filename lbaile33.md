## Background

I am currently a junior at the University of Tennessee, I have grown up around computers and playing on them since a young age. As I've grown older I've always wanted to get rid of the idea of the "Magic Box" that is computers so I decided to delve deeper into them and understand the inner workings.

## Interests

A huge interest of mine is the ongoing evolution of AI and how we can use it to shape ourselves by automating more and more complex tasks. Otherwise whenever I have free time I often fill the time with games. I am currently a League of Legends rep for the UTK Esports club building a team to compete in the coming fall and spring seasons.
If you happen to be interested in joining the league team you can find more information and join tryouts by filling out this form: https://forms.gle/xPmD3TknM2Xp5CXV9
