### Major: Computer Science


My perspective towards computer science is defined by its interdisciplinary potential. When I first learned to code in high school, I developed a passion for the logical and puzzle-like process of programming, and that became my drive for pursuing a major in CS. Here is a brief list describing my technical abilities:

+ C++/Python
+ HTML/CSS
+ Vim
+ Linux Terminal
+ Git

Outside of school, I enjoy creating art through a variety of mediums, including oil paints and color pencils. Here is a link to a popular art contest I participated in throughout high school: [Wildlife Forever State Fish Art](https://www.theartofconservation.org/2024-fish-art-winners).

I also love watching movies and having deep conversations with close family and friends.
