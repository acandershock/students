I am Trevor, a 20 year old coming all the way from metro Detroit down to Knoxville to major in computer science. I am interested solving problems using technology in a IT or cybersecurity context for my future careeer. For hobbies, I like to workout, run, explore the city, and maintain my plants. My favorite plants that I own is a [rubber ficus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_elastica). 

Over the summer, I worked in a Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology lab on developing a deep learning model for identifying cells we were interested in studying further. Through this experience, and from my past experiences, I have worked with...

1. Python
2. Java
3. C++ (my most comfortable)
4. R
