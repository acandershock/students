Major: Computer Science

Find out more about me on my [Personal Website](https://www.yousifabdulhussein.com/)!

## Background

My name is Yousif, and I enjoy making things. I got into computer science before I even knew what it was. Turns out, learning to design redstone contraptions teaches you a lot about logic and designing software.

## Interests

When I'm not at my job or doing schoolwork, I'm usually working on a hobby of mine. I consider myself a jack of all trades (and trying to learn more!) and a master of none when it comes to my hobbies. My favorites currently are:
- Running
- Making videos
- Finding ways of worrying my parents (to their dismay, I've gotten interested in skydiving).

## Tools

- C/C++
- Python (Pandas, Numpy)
- R
- HTML/CSS and JavaScript
- Bash
- React (Nextjs), Django, Flask, Svelte (Sveltekit)
- SQLite3, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Vercel

## Conclusion

I'm into a lot of things! Feel free to talk to me about anything (I've probably been interested by it at some point). I love meeting new people!
