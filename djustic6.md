## Personal Info:
- I come from a small town where I graduated highschool with a class size of 25.
- I love going to the gym, climbing, and gaming. Recently addicted to Elden Ring.
- Another interest I have is listening podcasts, my favorite one is a comedy pod with two guys named Sam. It is called [Forehead Fables](https://youtu.be/dk-DzDJK6t0?si=pR7n_8TbbyEWyfW_&t=3012).
- The main language I know is C++, but I know a little bit about Java and am currently learning C. I have also done a little bit with Unreal, but I am still a beginner and learning.
