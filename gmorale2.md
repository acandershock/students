## About Me
I am a junior in computer science and have lived in Knoxville for the past 12 years. 
I like to draw, paint, read manga, watch anime, and play video games. I've been playing a lot of [Ace Attorney](https://www.ace-attorney.com/) recently. I can speak Spanish and can understand Akateko somewhat.

## Skills 
- c++
- I have worked with python and java but I am definitely not confident in it at all.
