# About me
Philip Marino, typically go by Phil. I am familiar with C++ but have also dabbled in Python, Javascript, C# and various frameworks associated with them, most notably Django and Bootstrap. I have also done a little bit with version control but I am a bit rusty with it so I am excited to jump back into it.

### Interests
Hobbies include video games, golf, Volunteer athletics, physical fitness via weight lifting, and of course coding. Below is a link to my portfolio page I made using JS and bootstrap.
