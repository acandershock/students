### Summary
Hello, my name is William. I am a Junior studying Computer Science. 
In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, and doing crosswords.
I also really enjoy baking, especially [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie).

Controversial opinion: oatmeal raisin cookies are **severely** underrated and overhated.
