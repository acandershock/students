# My Background
I grew up in Knoxville, TN and started my college career as Exploratory before venturing into Mathematics.

After realizing the power that coding could have in my own life, I set out to be a CS major.

# My Interests

## An Introduction
I have a big interest in creating things that save people time. Thatâ€™s why I became a Computer Science major and became involved in software development and machine learning. 

## What This Class Means to Me
I see this class as an opportunity to innovate. A whole semester dedicated to making something great. If you are of a similar mindset, then please reach out. I love fresh takes on old ideas (when necessary) and intend to provide that impact when I graduate.

## What I Do On My Freetime
I do a lot of reading regarding business acumen, politics, technology and personal development. I believe in being a jack of all trades.
