I am a junior in Computer Science interested in working with embedded systems. I was born in Johnson City, Tennessee and have lived my whole life prior to college there. Outside of school, I have a keen interest in weightlifting, listening to music, and watching movies.

As a tidbit to elaborate on my interest in weightlifting, I am about to start reading *Scientific Principles of Hypertrophy Training* by [Dr. Mike Israetel](https://www.strongerexperts.com/pages/mikeisraetel), possibly my favorite expert on the science of weightlifting and building muscle.

## Some tools/langauages I am familar with:
    - C++
    - Typescript
    - GitLab 
    - Linux mint
    - SVN
    - AWS
