    <p>
      Going further into my experience, my last three internships have been in
      cybersecurty. The first was with the government where I did more general
      cyber such as researching phising attacks and making a campaign to
      increase awarness on different sorts of phising attacks for the rest of
      the department and other more basic cyber background. The second and third
      were at Pilot Company and they were a lot more technically heavy. I mostly
      worked with the Automation, Application Security, and Networking teams to
      complete my projects.
