# Background

I grew up in west Tennessee, so coming to UTK was the obvious choice for me. I also grew up enjoying spending my time on a pc or
console, so I took an interest in studying computer science in school.

# Interests

As stated in my background, I enjoy spending time online (usually through video games or social media). I also have a passion 
for weightlifting and bodybuilding, and I have been doing so for a little over two years now. This link is for a page discussing
