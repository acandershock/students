## Background
I came from Korea during high school. As I was very interested in how programs work, I naturally chose Computer Science as my major, even though I didn't actually know much about it at the time.

## interests
Recently, I've become fascinated with classical music. While I feel that other types of music can be distracting when I study, classical music doesn't have that effect. The following link is to the classical music I listen to while doing assignments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwY7w0k3j2Y&list=PLXxHwmmGjcoscg7R9xLJYBllFHhzxRXbb
