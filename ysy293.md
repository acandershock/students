I am a senior at UT in computer science, however I am one year behind since I chose my major late. I grew up in Jacksonville, FL but came to UTK from Nashville, TN.

I love to hang out with my friends in my free time and do whatever they're doing, but my other hobbies include playing video games, snowboarding/swimming, watching anime, and doom-scrolling TikTok/Instagram.
Here is a link to the Ski Resort I go to every winter: [Cataloochee Ski Area](https://cataloochee.com/)

The only formal language I would say I'm very proficient in is C++, but I have experience in JavaScript, Python, and C. 
I am somewhat familiar with GitHub as I used it to complete coding assignements and practice in CS102.
