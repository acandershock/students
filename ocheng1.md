## About Me
Hi, everyone! My name is Olivia Cheng. I'm a junior at UT Knoxville from Memphis, TN. I have a [French & Francophone Studies minor](https://wlc.utk.edu/french/minor/) and just spent my entire summer in Paris! In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), and (recently) climbing.
