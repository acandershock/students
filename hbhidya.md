## About me

- netid: hbhidya
- github username: Hadib-byte

Hello, I'm Hadi! I am a junior studying computer science and I interned at Pilot Flying J this past summer in their Enterprise Applications department which allowed me to gain some experience with AWS and SQL in their C# codebase. As for my interests within computer science, I want to pursue Machine Learning / AI or maybe cybersecurity. However, my personal interests are pretty seperate to CS. I love food! Cooking and eating and trying new restuarants is my favorite thing to do. I also love movies and watching new ones and ranking them.
