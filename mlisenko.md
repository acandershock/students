**Major**: Computer Science 


## Background
I am from Memphis, TN and will graduate from UT in May, 2026. I am conversational in Russian and have lived in Russia, Belgium, and Finland.


## Interests
While I am thinking about studying cyber-security, I don't have a specfic field in computer science that I am focused on.
In high school I did a lot of graphic design and digital art so any ways of combining those interests with computer science is something I want to also look into.
