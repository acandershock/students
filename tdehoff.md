# Introduction

Hi! My name is Tatiana Dehoff. I am a Junior-year Computer Science student.

## Background

I moved to Tennessee eight years ago from Russia, where I completed four semesters of university majoring in Computational Linguistics. I didn’t enjoy the major or the country, so eventually I decided to move to the U.S. Since then, I’ve had many fun jobs until I was finally ready to go back to college. Ever since moving here, I’ve known that I wanted to attend UTK for Computer Science. Currently, I work as a Research Assistant at the Innovative Computing Laboratory here at UT.

## Interests

Academically, I am very interested in High-Performance Computing and Machine Learning. I enjoy working on complex problems and hope to become an expert in CUDA one day.  
In my free time, I like to work out, and play computer games. Let me know if you're into [Dead by Daylight](https://deadbydaylight.com/)!
