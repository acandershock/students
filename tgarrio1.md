## Background
I am a military child so I have moved around a lot in my life and have actually lived overseas more than I have lived in the United States.

## Interests
I love tech and learning about how different things work and all the new things in the space. I also really enjoy playing video games and am interested in things like game development don't really know much.

A more specific example of something I like learning about in the tech space is how AI can be used in other fields such as healthcare. For example [AI is being used to help diagnosis breast cancer](https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/06/24/ai-breast-cancer-diagnosis/) and I feel like a lot of people don't think about how AI can be used in areas like this.

## Computer Languages
The coding languages I have the most experience using is definitely C++/java. In highschool I did very very basic web development and used html and Adobe Dreamweaver but I highly doubt that will help for this.
