### Background:
I was born in Arcadia, California. When I was younger, I played baseball and loved
skateboarding but at the age of 8, when my family moved to Franklin, TN, my interests
made a 180. I became computer obsessed, likely to the detriment of my physical health.
I played more video games than I'd like to admit, primarily Minecraft and other
sandbox games. At the age of 15, I picked up guitar. I played in a band from 2019
until its unfortunate demise earlier this year. While guitar is probably my favorite
thing to do, I plan to make a career out of coding which is a close second. 

### Interests
I sort of covered my interests in my background, but heres an unordered list
of my interests:
- Guitar
- Music
- Coding
- Graphic Design
- Video Games (primarily sandbox as aforementioned but I do like a variety of games)
- Photography
- Video Editing
- Reading
