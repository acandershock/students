## About me
I have been a resident of Knoxville for the past 18 years. I would like to use my degree to pursue a career in software engineering. 
Some of my interests include sculpting, painting, anime/manga, and roller skating. Here is a [website](https://www.clay-it-now.com/clay-it-now-blog.html) for beginner sculptors.
