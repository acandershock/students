## Background
    Hello! My name is Jasmine, and I’m originally from Vietnam, now living in Knoxville. I’m a Junior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), while also working full-time in the beauty industry.

    I initially attended Business School but decided to pivot in 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. My curiosity in STEM led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. My strength lies in solving technical issues, though I recognize that persuasive communication is an area for improvement.

    So far, I have successfully navigated the challenges of this major, and I'm proud of how far I've come. For me, the milestones in Computer Science feel more tangible and achievable than those in marketing.
## Interests
    I would love to be in nature with my favorite people regardless of the activity category. I'm also interested in occasionally attending meaningful workshops to upgrade my skills and, if possible, volunteering in some community-supporting events. Tech and the Environment are my all-time concerns. Additionally, coding or driving at night is another favorite hobby of mine. I love self-paced learning because of its variety of topics and independence.
## Goals
    I am preparing for the upcoming internship fairs and looking forward to gaining more software-building experience. I aim to be proficient in software engineering and system management in 5 years. My ultimate goal is to travel the world and teach people who have the least access to technology development or education in general.
