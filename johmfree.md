## Learn the secrets to immortality!

I'm an absent-minded computer tinkerer and coder, originally from Nashville, 
TN. Outside of that, I mostly just play videogames and listen to music, and 
sometimes draw.

### The world is only getting smaller.

Languages, tools, and frameworks I'm familiar with:
1. C/C++
2. Git
3. Make
4. Markdown (as of this very moment)

### Who are you?

It's no [secret](http://endless.horse) to me.
