## Background
I was born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee. I have lived here all my life, and have always been interested in all things computers. Especially though, I have been interested in Game Design. For major portions of my life I have always worked on small little projects, but nothing too big to note. Mainly testing out various technologies and always finding out the ins and outs of how something was made in a video game. Currently I am Senior at UTK, going onto my fourth year of college with still one more to go.
