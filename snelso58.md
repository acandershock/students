## Bio information
I'm originally a land surveyor from Montana, but I'm allergic to everything that grows. Hence, I'm seeking an indoor career.

A longtime interest of mine is firearms. I like reloading, historic firearms, modern guns, all of it. One of my favorite websites for keeping up is [The Firearm Blog](www.thefirearmblog.com). The site's subtext is 'firearms, not politics,' which is where I'm at. Appreciating small arms technology is the end, not a means to another.

All of my programming knowledge is academic, so it's primarily C++ with some C. I used Python last summer for a scientific computing course and I get the appeal. It's very handy and easier to work with than C++. I've done some light work with HTML but wouldn't consider myself proficient by a great stretch
