## Bio information
I'm originally a land surveyor from Montana, but I'm allergic to everything that grows. Hence, I'm seeking an indoor career.

A longtime interest of mine is firearms. I like reloading, historic firearms, modern guns, all of it. One of my favorite websites for checking the pulse of the topic is [The Firearm Blog](www.thefirearmblog.com). The site's subtext is 'firearms, not politics,' which is where I'm at. Apperciating small arms technology is the end, not means to another.

All of my programming knowledge is academic, so it's primarily C++ with some C. I used Python last summer for a scientific computing course and I get the appeal. I've done some light work with HTML but wouldn't consider myself proficient by a great stretch
