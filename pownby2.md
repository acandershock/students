# About Me

## Background
  - I am entering my third year as a CS student at UT, which is where I have
    learned the majority of my technical skills.
  - This summer, I interned as an Automation Engineer at Kendall Electric here
    in Knoxville. I gained skills in PLC programming as well as sales knowledge
    of Industrial Automation products.
  - I have been actively working on a Linux web server hosted for free by Oracle.
    Right now I have taken down most of the pages but I actively host an 
    instance of the search engine Whoogle, which you can find [here](https://search.plezownby.dev/).
  - Languages (most to least confident): C++, Java, MATLAB, HTML, Ladder, CSS, 
    Bash, LaTeX, Structured Text, GDScript, C 
  - Tools: Linux(Arch, Deb, RHEL), Vim, Git, VSCode, Docker

## Interests
  - I am interested in open-source software, as well as the general the [FOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.en.html)
    philosophy. I believe software should be written with lower-end hardware
    in mind, and be completely open and transparent with its users. I use 
    a 13-year-old ThinkPad X220 as my school/personal laptop, which serves as a 
    good benchmark for modern-software optimization.
  - I do a bit of reading, mostly religious texts, but I do enjoy authors like
    Dostoevsky.
  - Gaming has always been a heavy interest of mine; I play a little bit of
    everything. Right now I'm playing Fallout: London and Yakuza.
